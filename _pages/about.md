I'm currently a Masters student in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University. Prior to Masters, I completed a Bachelor of Science double majoring in Mathematics and Astronomy an Astrophysics before an Honours year (Bachelor of Science Honours) at the ANU.

Iâ€™ve worked on the chemical abundances and orbital dynamics of stars in our Milky Way, specifically related to the central Galactic bar and kinematic groups (or moving groups) in the solar neighbourhood.

I'm now working on an integrate field spectroscopy study of the edge-on barred galaxy NGC5746.
